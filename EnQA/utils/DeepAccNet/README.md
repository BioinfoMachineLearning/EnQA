# Transfer learning with DeepAccNet representation

For our lite model without using any AlphaFold2 generated feature, representations from DeepAccNet network are used instead. 
Here we provide a simplified version of DeepAccNet with the same code from its [official Repo](https://github.com/hiranumn/DeepAccNet).
