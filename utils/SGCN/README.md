# Feature generation using featurizers from Spherical graph convolutional networks 

The feautureize are from Spherical graph convolutional networks (S-GCN). Please refer to the following publication:
[Spherical convolutions on molecular graphs for protein model quality assessment Ilia Igashov et al 2021 Mach. Learn.: Sci. Technol](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2632-2153/abf856/pdf)

The featurizers from Spherical graph convolutional networks (S-GCN) are used to processe 3D models of proteins represented as molecular graphs.
Here we provide the voronota and spherical harmonics featurizer for Linux.

If you need to rebuild the voronota for a different system, please check out the [S-GCN Repo](https://gitlab.inria.fr/GruLab/s-gcn/-/tree/master/#voronota).

Also, there are [other versions of binaries](https://gitlab.inria.fr/GruLab/s-gcn/-/tree/master/#spherical-harmonics-featurizer) built for featurizer under a different system(Currently, only MacOS and Linux are supported).
